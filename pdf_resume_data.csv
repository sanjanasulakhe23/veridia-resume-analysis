Experience
Company Name July 2011 to November 2012 Accountant
City , State
Enterprise Resource Planning Office (ERO)
In this position as an Accountant assigned to the Defense Enterprise Accounting and Management System (DEAMS) ERO I was
responsible for identifying and resolving issues affecting the DEAMS General Ledger.
I worked with teammates from the Procure to Pay, Orders to Cash, and Budget to Report areas to resolve daily challenges encountered
with the deployment of DEAMS to additional customers and when system change requests were promoted to production.
I supported the testing of scripts, patches, and system change requests ensuring any anomalies were identified to the DEAMS Functional
Management Office for action by the DEAMS Program Management Office and/or the System Integrator.
In addition, I served on a tiger team designed to identify and resolve General Ledger posting differences and supported the development of
$360B in accounting adjustments allowing for the first successful fiscal year-end close in 2012.
These actions also allowed for the reconciliation and closure of fiscal year 2010 and 2011 accounting adjustments ensuring that all DEAMS
fiscal year-end requirements were completed.
These actions were recognized as critical to the successful review report issued by the Air Force Operational Test and Evaluation Center
(AFOTEC) resulting in the Air Force receiving the authority to continue with the deployment of DEAMS.
Company Name April 2010 to June 2011 Resource Advisor
City , State
In this position as Resource Advisor for the 1st Air Communications Operation Squadron (1ACOS) I was responsible for providing
financial advice and decision support to the Commander.
I was responsible for coordinating a $4.6M budget between four funding sources.
I coordinated with USAFE Directorate of Intelligence (USAFE/A2), USAFE Directorate of Air and Space Operations (USAFE/A3),
USAFE Directorate of Communications (USAFE/A6) and the 435th Air Ground Operations Wing to ensure 1ACOS meets its mission
requirements.
I consistently managed three separate timelines for providing budget/unfunded requirements, providing documentation and various reports in
the required format for each organization.
I discussed the outcome of the Group and Directorate budget meetings providing feedback the same day to the Flight Chiefs and CC any
issue which affects 1ACOS directly.
I monitored the Defense Travel System (DTS) daily and identify orders and authorizations needing approval and provided notification to the
appropriate Reviewing Officials and Approvers.
Utilizing DTS and the General Accounting and Finance System I reviewed status reports to identify anomalies in obligations and have
identified those orders which require correction prior to payment.
I provided Government Purchase Card (GPC) status reports the same day they are requested and in addition, communicated with the
appropriate cardholders when changes were required to support their program.
I identified cardholder training requirements and monitored these requirements to ensure all required training was completed in support of
this mission critical program.
I developed guidance for the GPC cardholders on procedures for requesting training for the squadron and in addition I provided answers to
cardholder questions on unique or non-standard issues/concerns.Assumed the role of the Billing Official during my final rating period and completed a self inspection of the program for the Management
Control Program, zero findings.

Company Name July 2008 to April 2010 Staff Accountant
City , State
In my position as the Staff Accountant for HQ USAFE I was responsible for providing accounting and financial oversight and advice to
customers throughout the Command in support of the USAFE Comptroller.
I was responsible for performing ongoing analysis of financial programs to identify negative trends and weaknesses, ensured specific
weaknesses were corrected, and determined whether systemic or repeat issues were identified and adequately addressed.
I was required to apply a comprehensive knowledge of analysis/reporting requirements and data produced to resolve these issues.
In collaboration with DFAS Europe, developed an automated tool that identifies duplicate obligations by comparing records in the
accounting system to the contracting system and provided notification to the funds manager for review and resolution.
This tool eliminated hours of manual research and results allowed HQ USAFE to deobligate over $5M in duplicate obligations.
I was responsible for establishing various performance metrics which ensured effective and efficient use of USAFE financial resources.
I supported the USAFE/FMA Financial metrics program by collaborating with DFAS Limestone in the development of an automated tool
that provided senior leaders with visibility to any USAFE unit that is not in compliance with the established rules and regulations related to
the GPC.
This tool provides management reports that are used to populate the monthly metric charts which are briefed by the USAFE/FMA.
This tool provided the capability for USAFE/FMA to collaborate with USAFE Contracting and develop/deploy joint guidance that supports
the established Air Force Instruction mandating card suspension for card holders who are not in compliance with required reservation of
funds in the entitlement system in support of the GPC.
I identified and resolved a problem with five GPC accounts that had been rejecting during the automated interface process each month.
My research revealed that these accounts were rejecting for invalid paying station and required manual intervention by both Wing and
DFAS personnel.
This not only created rework, it delayed the payment of the invoices.
I partnered with DFAS Denver, corrected the records in the Access On-Line accounts eliminating the error condition.
I identified a method to deliver one-on-one training in support of the USAFE deployment of the Open Document Analysis (ODA) tool in
FMSuite.
By utilizing Defense Connect Online I provided training remotely, virtually eliminating the need to expend funds on Temporary Duty (TDY)
travel.
The results of this training produced results that went well above expectations and were noted by the ODA Program Management Office.

Limestone reorganized under the High Performing Organization (HPO) in January 2007 and at that time I was reassigned to AM&C, a
Directorate which previously did not exist.
My challenge during that time was to staff my branch, implement an aggressive training schedule, and ensure the continuity of financial

As we transitioned into the HPO we continued defining the missions and functions for AM&C for the entire network.
I participated in biweekly conference calls with Standards and Compliance in an effort to define missions and functions for AM&C.

01/2003 to Current
VP, Principal Company Name ï¼​ City , State
Architected and developed an innovative product called ""IBOR 1.0"" to provide real-time market values,exposures and related analytics
using operational data store(ODS). This product has capability to show look-through exposure to complex instruments(e.g.
pools,funds,ETF) and exotic derivative products(e.g. total return swap,index future). A game changing product being used very broadly at
Wellington by our investors and clients since 2007.
Designed and developed a data quality reconciliation process to detect,respond and prevent data quality issues in a production environment
for a mission critical product.
Delivered many quality products to production well in time and under budget with very limited number of resources and proactively took
ownership to resolve complex problems faced by the team. As a result, I have achieved highest ratings ever possible by my manager for
more than 10 years in a row.
Built a very strong and resilient team(from 4 team members to over 50) to support huge demand for the products developed by my team. I
was responsible to develop,deliver and support multiple mission critical applications in production and I positioned my team well to innovate
new quality products as well as support existing products in production.
Led a team to design and develop a product to provide investment performance returns across all financial instruments using innovative in-
memory design. This product also provided a unique capability to provide look-through performance for the complex financial instruments at
Wellington. The new product improved system performance by huge margin over legacy product and running successfully in production
since 2013.
Led a team to successfully build and deliver a transaction processing system(known as unified transaction system) to represent transactions
in a unified format to provide rolled up positions,exposure and performance data to meet emerging business requirements.
Due to continued success and huge demand of products built by my team, my team was asked to build a next generation IBOR platform.
IBOR is a single source of truth for all investment holdings information, providing consistent, timely, and accurate position and exposure
information that helps the front office make investment decisions. The IBOR provides both current and historical operational investment data
and is used by many financial firms both in middle office and front office. IBOR is a perfect use case which combines both operational and
analytical workloads (aka hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP)). IBOR 2.0 is in production since Sep,2019 in AWS cloud
environment using GridGain Ignite in-memory computing platform.
My team is now working on to build IBOR+ using proprietary technology and database using HTAP architecture. As a principal architect
on IBOR+, I designed data model, instrument and transaction meta-models and other key foundational components to build a highly
available,reliable and optimized IBOR architecture. IBOR+ is a transaction based system to provide real-time positions,exposures and
investment performance data using one unified platform. IBOR+ provides both current and historical(as-of,as-at) data in lighting speed due
to very innovative and cutting edge technology. IBOR+ is a foundational data platform to enable tier1 applications to migrate from
monolithic architecture to service based architecture.
Designed,developed,implemented and supporting operational historical data store (ODS) application(>60TB) using Oracle Exadata. The
ODS maintains historical positions,exposure and performance data. My team also migrated data and built a data pipeline from Oracle toAmazon Redshift to provide faster performance for OLAP and time series analysis.
Designed, developed,implemented fixed income portfolio management tool(FIPMT 4.0) to enable investors to make best investment
decisions to return positive alpha for our clients. As a lead database developer, I contributed to solve database slowness problems by tuning
complex database queries and improve data modeling to improve overall system performance of the system.
Designed and developed meta-data using yaml to represent complex business rules and application logic. Developed an automated process
to update meta-data in yaml format using Python to improve efficiency and time to market. Integrate metadata with Collibra to show data
lineage, data dependency and other related information across multiple applications

AGRICULTURE,"EDUCATION OFFICER & SENIOR EDUCATION OFFICER GUIDANCE & COUNSELING UNIT
Professional Summary
I joined the Ministry of Education in 1982 and was posted at the R.M.Bailey Senior High School where I remained for seventeen and a half
wonderful years. I served as Head of the Guidance Department from 1991 to 1999 until my redeployment to Special Services Section to oversee
the Guidance & Counseling Unit upon the retirement of the former officer. I enjoyed my experience at R.M.Baily and have had the pleasure of
working with and assisting students even after my departure from the school, I am still counseling many of them and their children today.
I have had the opportunity of supervising the Guidance & Counseling Unit over the past sixteen years and watched it grow from forty- two (42)
counselors in 1999 to one hundred and thirty two (132) in 2015, posted in ninety-four schools on fourteen islands and cays throughout the
country. During my leadership, we collaborated with the College of The Bahamas and Kent State University and established a Master's of
Education Degree Program in School Counseling from 2001 to 2011. Eighty- nine (89) persons obtained the Masters Degree, and the unit has the
largest amount of employees with this Degree in the Ministry of Education. I realized in order for the unit to move forward, ongoing training was a
requirement for all officers, which kept them informed about the latest techniques and strengthened areas of concern. We also established a crisis
team that assists with grief and disaster counseling.
The needs of students were being met but those of the employees were not and after visiting the school district in Dallas Texas, I learned about the
Employee Assistance Program, and implemented it at the Ministry of Education on a smaller scale. This proved to be very successful but the need
for expansion was necessary. Upon the retirement of Mrs. Pansy Hamilton Brown, Iris Strachan, and Clevette Gibson took the reins and took
EAP to the next level. The demands on the officers made me realize that the service needed to be made available to all government employees and
the idea to expand the service was decided. I enjoyed my role as Senior Education Officer and if given the opportunity would like to be a part of
taking EAP to the next level.

Professional Profile
Ever since I've been able to work I have, the day I turned 16 I got a job at Wal-Mart and I was with Wal-Mart for about a year and a half. My
only reason for leaving my job at Wal-Mart was because I had to get a second job for my co-op class that I had in high school. I did work both
jobs for a few months but I had to quit at Wal-Mart because they couldn't work with my other job schedule. While I was an associate at Wal-
Mart I did work different departments such as apparel, jewelry, and I worked as a cashier. I currently work at a Childcare to help me pursue my
future career in Speech and Language Pathology. I have experience in customer service, and talking to parents and children. I consider myself a
very driven hard worker, if I am given a task I complete it to my best ability.
